- 👋 Hi, I’m Adi (@adirao-projects)
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in backend technologies, but my primary focus is in physics and mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m currently a student at the University of Toronto for Physics and Mathematics (with CS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's pretty cool.
- 📫 You can reach me mainly through my github, or other socials. The best way to get in touch is over email (on my website).
